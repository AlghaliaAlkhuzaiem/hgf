            Sherlock Holmes is a fictional detective created by British author Arthur Conan Doyle.
             Referring to himself as a "consulting detective" in the stories, Holmes is known for his proficiency with 
             observation, deduction, forensic science and logical reasoning that borders on the fantastic, which he employs when
              investigating cases for a wide variety of clients, including Scotland Yard.
